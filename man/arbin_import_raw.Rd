arbin_import_raw(file, step.time = TRUE, energy = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The filename, which must end in .xls or .xlsx.}

\item{step.time}{Defaults to TRUE. Includes the step time variable from the data file if TRUE.}

\item{energy}{Defaults to TRUE. Includes the (dis)charge energy variables from the data file if TRUE.}

\description{
This function is a simplified version of arbin_import which does not output a separate
statistics data frame. Consequently the output is a data frame rather than a list.
}
\examples{
mydataset <- arbin_import("dataset.xlsx")
mydataset <- arbin_import("dataset.xlsx", step.time = FALSE)
}
